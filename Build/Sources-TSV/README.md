# ParlaMint Sources-TSV

This directory contains the TSV metadata files and the top-level `listPerson` and `listOrg` XML files that this metadata should be added to,
along with the build environment (Makefile) for this metadata enrichment.
The output `listPerson` and `listOrg` files are written to [Sources-TEI](../Sources-TEI) and overwrite these two files there.

The work-flow for adding metadata has the following steps:
1. From the corpus in [Sources-TEI](../Sources-TEI)/ParlaMint-XX.TEI/ copy the
  `ParlaMint-XX-listPerson.xml` and `ParlaMint-XX-listOrg.xml` to [Sources-TSV](../Sources-TSV)/ParlaMint-XX/
2. For one of the defined layers for metadata addition (see below) run `make` with the appropriate target,
   e.g. `make generate-ministers CORPUS=XX' to initialise the appropriate automatically generated TSV file for this corpus
   (in this case [Sources-TSV](../Sources-TSV)/ParlaMint-XX/Ministers-XX.auto.tsv).
3. Copy this file to its edited variant, by substituting `.auto.` with `.edited.`.
   (in this case to [Sources-TSV](../Sources-TSV)/ParlaMint-XX/Ministers-XX.edited.tsv)
4. Edit the `.edited.` file and insert the required metadata without chaning the columns for country and
   person/organisation key.
5. Once finished, run `make insert-metadata CORPUS=XX`, which will insert the metadata in the `.edited.` TSV files
   into [Sources-TEI](../Sources-TEI)/ParlaMint-XX.TEI/ and [Sources-TEI](../Sources-TEI)/ParlaMint-XX.TEI.ana/
   `ParlaMint-XX-listPerson.xml` and/or `ParlaMint-XX-listOrg.xml` files.

To define a new type of metadata to insert, e.g. `zz`, the appropriate scripts need to be written and placed in
 [Build/Scripts](../Scripts/), in particular `zz-tei2tsv.xsl` and `zz-tsv2tei.xsl` (existing scripts can be of help),
 the script [add-metadata.pl](../Scripts/add-metadata.pl) and the [Makefile](Makefile) in this directory extended
 with the new scripts.

Each ParlaMint-XX/ directory can contain the following:

## Source TEI files
The input ParlaMint XML files, must be present:
* `ParlaMint-XX-listOrg.xml`: the list of organisations
* `ParlaMint-XX-listPerson.xml`: the list of speakers

## TSV metadata files with minister affiliations
These TSV files are meant for inserting minister affiliations into ParlaMint speakers,
i.e. into `ParlaMint-XX-listPerson.xml`
and can contain the following files for country `XX`:
* `Ministers-XX.auto.tsv`: automatically generated list of ministers from source corpus
* `Ministers-XX.edited.tsv`: hand-edited list of ministers
* `Ministers-XX.log`: log of trying to merge the hand-edited list of ministers into the listPerson

## TSV metadata files with CHES political orientations
These TSV files are meant for inserting CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) political orientations into ParlaMint organisations,
i.e. into ParlaMint-XX-listOrg.xml
and can contain the following files for country `XX`:
* `OrientationCHES-XX.edited.tsv`: generated list of CHES variables from the source CSV files,
  together with the mapping of political party or parliamentary group IDs from CHES to those of ParlaMint

Note that these files are not "edited" as such but are pre-processed, which is done in the [CHES/](CHES/) directory.

## TSV metadata files with Wiki political orientations
These TSV files are meant for inserting WikiPedia left-to-right political orientations into ParlaMint organisations,
i.e. into ParlaMint-XX-listOrg.xml
and can contain the following files for country `XX`:
* `OrientationWiki-XX.auto.tsv`: automatically initialised list of left-to-right political orientations from source corpus
* `OrientationWiki-XX.edited.tsv`: hand-edited list of left-to-right political orientations 
  together with the URL of the source Wikipedia page and optional comment

## TSV metadata files with encoder political orientations
These TSV files are meant for inserting encoder-determined WikiPedia left-to-right political orientations into ParlaMint organisations,
i.e. into ParlaMint-XX-listOrg.xml
and can contain the following files for country `XX`:
* `OrientationEnco-XX.edited.tsv`: hand-edited list of left-to-right political orientations 
  together with the ID of the encoder (should be defined in the corpus root file) and optional comment

## TSV metadata files with speaker sex (currently only BA, HR, SR)
These TSV files are meant for inserting missing or wrongly determined sex of ParlaMint speakers,
i.e. into `ParlaMint-XX-listPerson.xml`;
and can contain the following files for country `XX`:
* `Sex-XX.auto.tsv`: dump of all speakers with speaker ID, name and surname, and current sex, 'U' if missing
* `Sex-XX.edited.tsv`: automatically or hand fixed list of the sex of speakers; columns are identical to the .auto version,
  and only the sex column should be changed. Contains only the U(nknown) gender persons from `Sex-XX.auto.tsv`;
  if it is empty, it means that all persons in source corpus have known gender.
