This directory contains the so called vertical files (the format used by the CQP
and (no)Sketch Engine concordancers), which were automatically coverted from the
linguistically encoded TEI.ana version of the machine translated ParlaMint-XX corpus.
Note that the vertical files do not contain all the information from the source TEI,
and that they used different element and attribute names from the TEI source.

Also included is the registry file, which is needed for noSketch Engine or
KonText (or, rather, their manatee back-end) to compile and mount the
corpus. The registry file has various values (such as paths to the data files)
that are specific to the noSketch Engine installation at CLARIN.SI, so they need
to be changed for any local installation of the corpus.
