# ParlaMint Corpora Log files

This directory contains the log files made by the release pipeline.
For each corpus there are 3 files:
* `ParlaMint-XX.log`: the complete log for ParlaMint-XX
* `ParlaMint-XX.warn.log`: warnings only
* `ParlaMint-XX.error.log`: errors only

The logs above are also present with the -en suffix (e.g. `ParlaMint-XX-en.log`) which are the logs for corpora
which have been machine translated to English.
