        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>This document is meant so serve as a reference for the encoding of ParlaMint
        corpora of parliamentary proceedings. In order for the ParlaMint corpora to be
        interoperable (i.e. so that the same scripts can be used to process them), their
        structure is fairly rigid, both in terms of file names and folder structure, as well
        as their TEI XML encoding. This is not to say that all the corpora have to contain
        exactly the same information because we distinguish obligatory information, which
        all the corpora should contain, from that which is optional, and present only in the
        corpora for which it has been possible to gather it from the corpus sources.</p>

	<p>This document is a specialisation of <ref
	target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/parla-clarin">Parla-CLARIN</ref>, itself a
	customisation the <ref
	target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">TEI
	Guidelines</ref>. But while Parla-CLARIN gives fairly general recommendations for
	encoding corpora of parliamentary proceedings, ParlaMint, as mentioned, is much
	stricter. This document gives very specific encoding recommendations without
	necessarily stating the reasons for their choice.</p>

	<p>The document is not meant as a tutorial on TEI or ParlaMint, but as a reference to
	elements, their nesting and attributes exemplified by snippets from the existing ParlaMint
	corpora. Other sources can help in understanding the encoding of ParlaMint corpora:

      <div xml:id="chp-overall">
        <head>Overall corpus structure</head>
        
        <p>Each ParlaMint corpus is one XML document, which has as its root the
        <gi>teiCorpus</gi> element, which then contains a <gi>teiHeader</gi> giving the
        metadata for the corpus as a whole (further detailed in the Section on <ref
        target="#sec-metadata">Corpus metadata</ref>), followed by a series of <gi>TEI</gi>
        elements that each contain one <term>corpus component</term>, as illustrated<note>Note
        that this is a illustrative example, i.e. a valid ParlaMint corpus would also need
        certain attributes to be defined on the illustrated elements. This holds for all the
        examples in this section.</note> below:
        
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-docstructure">
          <teiCorpus>
            <!-- Common corpus metadata: -->
            <teiHeader>...</teiHeader>
	    <!-- First corpus component: -->
            <TEI>...</TEI>
	    <!-- Second corpus component: -->
            <TEI>...</TEI>
	    <!-- More corpus components: -->
	    ...
          </teiCorpus>
        </egXML>
	
	The fact that a corpus is one XML document does not mean that it is also stored
	in one file. In fact, ParlaMint requires that each corpus component is
	stored as one file, with the corpus root also stored as one file.</p>

	<p>To enable one XML document to be composed of many files, we use the <ref
	target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/">XInclude</ref> mechanism, and the
	<term>corpus root</term> will XInclude its <term>corpus component</term> files, so a
	corpus root will be in fact encoded similarly to the following example:

        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-docstructure-root">
          <teiCorpus>
            <!-- Common corpus metadata: -->
            <teiHeader>...</teiHeader>
	    <!-- Reference to the first corpus component: -->
            <![CDATA[<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
		     href="2014/ParlaMint-NL_2014-04-16.xml"/>]]>
	    <!-- Reference to the second corpus component: -->
            <![CDATA[<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
		     href="2014/ParlaMint-NL_2014-04-17.xml"/>]]>
	    <!-- References to more corpus components: -->
	    ...
          </teiCorpus>
        </egXML>
        </p>

        <p>Each corpus component should contain at most the transcripts for one day, although
        several components can contain the transcript for the same day, e.g. for different
        (types of) meetings. How and if these further subdivisions into separate components
        are realised is dependent on the corpus, as the granularity of parliamentary
        proceedings corpora, not to mention the national rules of structuring the workings of
        the parliament, differ substantially.</p>

	<p>A corpus component will thus be rooted in the <gi>TEI</gi> element, which
	then contains its own <gi>teiHeader</gi>, followed by the <gi>text</gi> element,
	which contains only the <gi>body</gi> element, this one containing the
	transcription of the particular component, as illustrated below:
	
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-docstructure-comp">
          <TEI>
	    <!-- Corpus component metadata: -->
            <teiHeader>...</teiHeader>
	    <!-- Transcription: -->
            <text>...</text>
          </TEI>
        </egXML>
	</p>
	
	<p>The <gi>teiHeader</gi> of a corpus component (further detailed in the Section on
	<ref target="#sec-metadata">Corpus metadata</ref>) contains the metadata specific for
	this component (along with some redundant metadata about the provenance), and which
	should be unique in the corpus, i.e. the corpus component metadata should distinguish
	it from all the other components of the corpus.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div xml:id="chp-general">
        <head>General requirements</head>
        
        <p>This section gives some general requirements a ParlaMint corpus has to meet, in
        particular those relating to the characters in a corpus, and the use of
        standards. It also details the structure of the file names of the ParlaMint root and
        component files, as well as the exact form of the <gi>teiCorpus</gi> and
        <gi>TEI</gi> tags.</p>
	
	<div xml:id="sec-chars">
          <head>Characters</head>
          
          <p>The corpus should be encoded in Unicode, using the UTF-8 character encoding, at
          least for European languages.  In cases where the original contains characters from
          the Unicode Private Use Area, these should, if possible, be given their closest
          Unicode equivalents or substituted by the Unicode replacement character
          U+FFFD. End-of-line hyphens, if present in the source files, should be removed, and
          the split words joined in order to enhance searching the corpus and to simplify
          linguistic processing.</p>
          
          <p>The following characters, esp. prevalent when the source documents were in Word or
          HTML, deserve special mention:
          
          <list>
            <item>TAB (U+0009) character helps the alignment of strings on successive
            lines.  As Parla-CLARIN is not interested in preserving the details of the
            layout, it is recommended that tab characters are substituted by the 
            space character (U+0020).</item>
            
            <item>NO-BREAK SPACE (U+00A0) prevents, with some applications, an automatic
            line break at its position and collapsing consecutive such space characters
            into a single space. As the use of this character complicates (or breaks)
            further processing, esp. linguistic annotation, it is recommended that these
            characters are substituted by the normal space character (U+0020). The same
            holds for other variants of spaces (U+2000 - U+200A), which are, however,
            used much less frequently.</item>
            
            <item>NON-BREAKING HYPHEN (U+2011), similarly to NO-BREAK SPACE, prevents a
            line break, in this case following its position. With a similar reasoning as
            above, and, additionally, complicates searching, it is recommended that this
            character is substituted by the normal hyphen character ('-', U+002D).</item>
            
            <item>SOFT HYPHEN (U+00AD) indicates that a word can be hyphenated at that
            point. Occurrences of this character should be removed from the corpus.</item>
          </list>
          </p>
          
          <p>Text-bearing elements should also not start or end with space characters, and
          sequences of whitespace characters should be changed into a single space.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-standard">
          <head>Standard values</head>
	  
          <p>Whenever possible, ParlaMint uses standards for information coding. In
          particular, the following information must be standardised:
	  <list>
	    <item>As the identity of a ParlaMint corpus is determined by the country or
	    region of the particular parliament, its code appears in many places. For
	    specifying these codes, the <ref
	    target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes">ISO
	    3166</ref> standard should be used, in particular <ref
	    target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">ISO 3166-1
	    alpha-2</ref> for the two letter codes of the countries (for national
	    parliaments) and <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2">ISO
	    3166-2</ref> for the names of country subdivision (for parliaments of autonomous
	    provinces). So, for example, the country code for Spain is "ES", while the code
	    for the autonomous Basque community is "ES-PV".</item>
	    
	    <item>The codes for the languages used in the corpora (i.e. the possible values
	    of the <att>xml:lang</att> attribute) should follow <ref
	    target="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47</ref> (cf. also <q><ref
	    target="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-when-xmllang">xml:lang in
	    XML document schemas</ref></q>. Essentially, this means that the value for a
	    language code should have two letters, following <ref
	    target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO_639-1</ref>
	    or, and only if a two letter code does not exist for a language, the
	    three-letter <ref target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-2">ISO
	    639-2/T</ref> code. For example, the code for Basque is 'eu'. ParlaMint corpora
	    will use at least two languages, i.e. the language that the transcriptions are
	    written in, which we will call the <term>local language</term> and English, as
	    the meta-language, which is (also) used in the metadata.
	    </item>
	    
	    <item>ParlaMint also makes a lot of use of temporal information, i.e. to
	    determine when a session took place or from (and maybe to) when a certain
	    person was an MP. To specify a date or time <ref
	    target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</ref> should be used,
	    for ParlaMint typically gives just the date, e.g. "2022-04-01". Temporal values
	    are usually stored in the <att>when</att>, <att>from</att> and <att>to</att>
	    attributes of various elements.</item>
	  </list>
          </p>
        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-files">
          <head>File names and directory structure</head>

	  <p>The file names of a ParlaMint XML corpus root and its components have a fairly
	  rigid structure:
	  <list>
	    <item>The corpus root file name should start with the string
	    <q>ParlaMint-</q>, followed by the country (or region) code, e.g. (assuming the
	    country code for the corpus is <q>NL</q>) <q>ParlaMint-NL.xml</q>.</item>
	    
	    <item>For special cases, such as a corpus that has been (machine-)translated to
	    a language different from the original language of the transcriptions, we also
	    require the code of the language to follow the country code, e.g. (assuming the
	    language code for the translated corpus is <q>en</q>) the corpus root file
	    should be named <q>ParlaMint-XX-yy.xml</q>.
	    </item>

	    <item>A corpus component always starts with the name of the root, followed by an
	    underscore and the date of the transcript, for example
	    <q>ParlaMint-NL_2018-10-30.xml</q></item>

	    <item>In case a corpus component is further distinguished by e.g. the type of
	    session because there are several components with the same date, the corpus
	    compilers are free to extend the file name by a hyphen and any suffix, which
	    should, however, contain only ASCII letters and numbers and the hyphen
	    character, e.g. <q>ParlaMint-NL_2018-10-30-eerstekamer-4.xml</q> or, for a Czech
	    component file, <q>ParlaMint-CZ_2016-04-13-ps2013-044-02-016-098.xml</q></item>

	    <item>The file names of the corpus as a whole or corpus components that have been
	    automatically converted from the source XML files should have the same name as
	    the corpus root or components, respectively, but with appropriate file
	    extensions; this is further explained in the Section on <ref
	    target="#sec-conversion">Conversions</ref>.</item>

	    <item><!-- Mention .ana! --></item>
	  </list>

	  The complete corpus should be stored in a directory that has the same name prefix
	  as the corpus root file. The directory then contains the corpus root file, while
	  the corpus components should be found in a subdirectory, one per year, for example:
	  
          <eg xml:id="exa-directories">
	    <code>ParlaMint-BE.TEI/ParlaMint-BE.xml</code><lb/>
	    <code>ParlaMint-BE.TEI/2014/ParlaMint-BE_2014-06-19.xml</code><lb/>
	    <code>ParlaMint-BE.TEI/2014/ParlaMint-BE_2014-06-30.xml</code><lb/>
	    <code>ParlaMint-BE.TEI/2014/ParlaMint-BE_2014-07-17.xml</code><lb/>
	    <code>ParlaMint-BE.TEI/2015/ParlaMint-BE_2015-01-06-54.xml</code><lb/>
	    <code>ParlaMint-BE.TEI/2015/ParlaMint-BE_2015-01-07-54.xml</code><lb/>
	    <code>ParlaMint-BE.TEI/2015/ParlaMint-BE_2015-01-08-54.xml</code><lb/>
	  </eg>
	  </p>
	</div>
	
	<div xml:id="sec-roottags">
          <head>Attributes of top-level elements</head>
	  
	  <p>The Chapter on <ref target="#chp-overall">Overall corpus structure</ref>
	  introduced the top level (root) elements of the corpus root file and of the
	  component files (i.e. the <gi>teiCorpus</gi> and <gi>TEI</gi> elements), but did
	  not elaborate on their attributes; these are presented in this section.</p>

	  <p>The corpus root has three required attributes, as shown below:
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-teiCorpusRoot">
            <![CDATA[<teiCorpus xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="ParlaMint-FR" xml:lang="fr">]]>
	  </egXML>

	  All three attributes can also be used on any other element, and are thus of
	  special importance:
	  <list>
	    <item><att>xmlns</att> determines the namespace of the element, and this should
	    always be the TEI namespace, i.e. <val>http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0</val>. Note
	    that all lower level elements in the same file inherit this namespace, so it is
	    not necessary (although it is not an error) for other elements to also define
	    their namespace.</item>
	    
	    <item><att>xml:id</att> is an attribute form the XML namespace, and gives
	    the identifier for the corpus root or component.  The value of an ID should
	    be unique in the corpus as a whole and should obey format requirements as
	    defined by <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-id/">W3C</ref>.
	    
	    For the corpus root and component files, it is required that
	    this top level identifier is identical to the file name (without the file
	    extension).

	    The <att>xml:id</att> is a global attribute, so any element can have
	    it. While this is not required, it is necessary for any element that
	    is then referred to (via this same ID) by some other element, such
	    as many elements in the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, as is explained in the
	    Section on <ref target="#sec-metadata">Corpus metadata</ref>.

	    The subordinate elements in the transcription that have an ID (such as
	    utterances and segments), should have the top level <att>xml:id</att> as a
	    prefix and indicate the element name in the ID. For example, if the top
	    level ID is <val>ParlaMint-GB_2021-01-06</val>, the first utterance
	    should have the ID <val>ParlaMint-GB_2021-01-06-lords.u1</val> and the first
	    segment <val>ParlaMint-GB_2021-01-06-lords.seg1</val>. The number of the
	    element should not have leading zeros.</item>
	    
	    <item><att>xml:lang</att> is also a global attribute and gives the language code
	    of the text content of the element. The convention is that language of the text
	    content of an element is determined by the value of the first
	    <att>xml:lang</att> attribute on its ancestor axis. In cases where the content is
	    multilingual, the language code should be of the majority language. When the
	    proportion of the languages is about equal, then the <q>mul</q> code for
	    multiple languages should be used.</item>
	  </list>
	  </p>

          <p>A corpus component also has the three required attributes, but
          additionally also the <att>ana</att> attribute:
	  
	  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-teiCorpusComp">
            <![CDATA[<TEI xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="ParlaMint-FR_2017-07-04-E1001" xml:lang="fr" ana="#parla.sitting #reference">]]>
	  </egXML>

	  The same as for the corpus root, the component also sets the TEI namespace, and
	  gives the language of its textual content, while its <att>xml:id</att>, of
	  course, identifies the particular component. The analysis attribute,
	  <att>ana</att> which is also used by many other elements, so we introduce it
	  here at more length:
	  <!-- Officially, the info in @ana should actually go in the
	       profileDesc/textClass - but it might be too late to change this now -->
	  <list>
	    <item><att>ana</att> serves to provide an analysis or, in ParlaMint, to
	    classify an element according to some pre-determined vocabulary. It is a
	    pointing attribute, which has as its value a white-space delimited sequence of
	    ID references, i.e. references to the values of some <att>xml:id</att>
	    attribute in the corpus. In general, they refer to the element IDs given in
	    other parts of the corpus root header, in this case, the categories of taxonomy
	    elements that specify that this component contains the transcription of one
	    sitting and belongs to the reference subcorpus; the structure and content of
	    the taxonomies used are further explained in the Section on the <ref
	    target="#sec-classDecl">Class declaration</ref>.</item>

        <head>Corpus metadata</head>
	
        <p>As mentioned, <gi>teiCorpus</gi> and <gi>TEI</gi> elements contain the obligatory
        <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, which stores the metadata to the corpus root or
        component. In this section we explain and give examples of the required and optional
        metadata that is contained in the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, proceeding through its various
        elements, and there distinguishing which parts and what content is appropriate for
        the corpus root, and which for a corpus component.</p>

	<p>As a general remark, most metadata contains free text, and it is a requirement of
	ParlaMint that this data is given in the English language, to help researchers for
	other countries to understand it, but also in the local language in which the (main
	portion of) parliamentary transcripts is written, for a local researcher to
	be able to use it in their native tongue.</p>

	<p>A ParlaMint <gi>teiHeader</gi> contains three obligatory elements: the file
	description, <gi>fileDesc</gi>, the encoding description, <gi>encodingDesc</gi>, and
	the profile description, <gi>profileDesc</gi>, and an optional revision description,

              </titleStmt>
	    </egXML>
	    The title statement starts with two titles (one main, the other subordinate), both
	    in English and the local language, with the appropriate language code possibly
	    inherited from a superordinate element. They are distinguished by the value
	    <val>main</val> or <val>sub</val> of their <att>type</att> attribute and the
	    value of their <att>xml:lang</att> attribute.</p>
	    
	    <p>The main title has a formulaic structure <q>&lt;Country name&gt; parliamentary
	    corpus ParlaMint-&lt;Country code&gt; [ParlaMint]</q>, with an equivalent
	    structure for the local language. Note that the corpus <q>stamp</q> in square
	    brackets can also be <q>[ParlaMint.ana]</q> for the linguistically annotated
	    version of the corpus (further explained in the Chapter on <ref
	    target="#chp-linguistic">Linguistic annotation</ref>) or <q>[ParlaMint SAMPLE]</q>
	    for corpus data samples, as available on the <ref
	    target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint/">ParlaMint GitHub
	    repository</ref>.</p>

	    <p>The subordinate title, in contrast to the main one, is free text, and usually
	    formed on the basis of the source of the corpus. As with the main one, it should
	    be given in both languages.</p>

	    <p>After the titles come the specification of the particular sessions that the
	    corpus contains, encoded as <gi>meeting</gi> elements: in free text, the two
	    meeting elements in the above example state that the ParlaMint-SI corpus contains
	    the meetings of the 7th and 8th terms of the lower house of the National Assembly
	    of the Republic of Slovenia. In terms of encoding, these elements can give, as the
	    value of their <att>n</att> attribute the number of the - in the case above -
	    meetings that the corpus covers, and their text content can give a free-text
	    description of the terms in the local language.</p>

	    <p>The formal information is given in the values of the <att>corresp</att> and
	    <att>ana</att> attributes, which are pointing attributes, as already explained in
	    the Section on <ref target="sec-roottags">Attributes of top-level
	    elements</ref>. Here they refer to the definition of organisations further explained
	    in the Section on <ref target="#sec-orgs">Organisations</ref> and the categories
	    of taxonomy elements, further explained in the Section on the <ref
	    target="#sec-classDecl">Class declaration</ref>. The value of the
	    <att>corresp</att> attribute points to the governmental body of which a particular
	    meeting element is a meeting of (in this case the National Assembly of the
	    Republic of Slovenia), while the <att>ana</att> attribute contains a
	    space-delimited sequence of pointers: <val>#parla.lower</val> points to the
	    definition of the lower house, <val>#parla.term</val> to the definition of a
	    parliamentary term, and <val>#DZ.7</val> to the definition of the seventh
	    mandate.
	    <!-- This is silly, why two attributes, why DZ in one, lowe in the other?? Issue? -->
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>Next come one or more responsibility statements, <gi>respStmt</gi>, each one
	    containing one or more person names, <gi>persName</gi>, with an optional
	    <att>ref</att> attribute, giving the URL, where more information about the person
	    can be found, and the responsibility element <gi>resp</gi>, which specifies what
	    responsibility the statement is about; as usual, the responsibility should be both
	    in the local language and in English.</p>

	    <p>In a similar manner, the <gi>funder</gi> elements give information on the
	    organisations which have financially contributed to the compilation of the corpus,
	    with the names of the organisations given in the <gi>orgName</gi> elements.</p>
	    
	    <p>A corpus component has a very similar title statement to the corpus root,
	    except that certain elements specify the metadata of the component, rather than
	    the complete corpus. Unlike with most other elements in the component header, we
	    here also have some redundant metadata, in particular, the responsibility statement
	    and the funder, as illustrated in the example below:
	    
	    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-titleStmtComp">
	      <titleStmt>
		<title type="main">Slovenski parlamentarni korpus ParlaMint-SI, izredna seja 59 [ParlaMint]</title>

	      </titleStmt>
	    </egXML>
	    In the example it can be seen that the main title of a corpus component is simply
	    an extension of the corpus root title, as it also gives the name of the particular
	    meeting that the component contains, while the subordinate title is, again, free
	    text. Both titles must be unique in the complete corpus.</p>

	    <p>The other difference is in the <gi>meeting</gi> elements, which here specify a
	    particular meeting, in this case, an extraordinary meeting of the lower house in
	    the seventh term of the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <div xml:id="sec-editionStmt">
            <head>Edition statement</head>
	    <p>ParlaMint corpora have their edition statement, <gi>editionStmt</gi> both in
	    the corpus root and components. As illustrated below, the only element it contains
	    is <gi>edition</gi>:
	    
	    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-editionStmt">
              <editionStmt>
		<edition>2.1</edition>
              </editionStmt>
	    </egXML>
	    We use semantic versioning to specify the version of the corpus, i.e. giving the
	    version number, where a new version means substantial changes to the corpus, while
	    the minor version is reserved for e.g. correcting errata or other minor
	    changes. We do not use the patch number. It should be noted that - at least so far
	    - all the ParlaMint corpora were released together, so that they are all of the
	    same edition, i.e. have the same version number. At the time of writing, the
	    latest version is 2.1, with the next one planned to be 3.0.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div xml:id="sec-extent">
            <head>Extents</head>
	    
	    <p>The <gi>extent</gi> element gives information on selected sizes of the
	    complete corpus (in the corpus root) or of one corpus component, as illustrated
	    below in the case of a corpus root extent:
	    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-extent">
              <extent>
		<measure unit="speeches" quantity="75122" xml:lang="sl">75.122 govorov</measure>
		<measure unit="speeches" quantity="75122" xml:lang="en">75,122 speeches</measure>
		<measure unit="words" quantity="20190034" xml:lang="sl">20.190.034 besed</measure>
		<measure unit="words" quantity="20190034" xml:lang="en">20,190,034 words</measure>
              </extent>
	    </egXML>
	    ParlaMint requires two sizes to be given, and in both languages, which are
	    distinguished by their <att>unit</att> attribute, namely the number of speeches
	    and the number of words. The exact quantity is given in the <att>quantity</att>
	    attribute, while the text content of <gi>measure</gi> gives the quantity together
	    with the unit - if possible, the number here should contain the thousands
	    separator appropriate for the language.</p>

	    <p>It should be noted that both sizes are somewhat complex to compute and are
	    inserted into the TEI headers in the finalisation of a corpus (cf. the Section on
	    <ref target="#sec-final">Finalisation of corpora</ref>) by a common script,
	    so it is not necessary to insert the extent in the process of developing a ParlaMint
	    corpus.</p>
	  </div>

	  <div xml:id="sec-publicationStmt">
            <head>Publication statement</head>

	    <p>The publication statement <gi>publicationStmt</gi> must appear in the corpus
	    root as well as, in identical form, in the corpus components. As illustrated
	    below, it contains information about the publisher of the corpus, the persistent

	    distributed, and when it was released:

	    <att>target</att> attribute of <gi>ref</gi>. As usual, the textual information is
	    given in both languages. Finally, the <gi>date</gi> gives the date of the release,

	    Apart from the bi-lingual <gi>title</gi>s, it should also give in <gi>idno</gi>
	    with the fixed <att>type</att> as <val>URI</val> the government URL where the

	    Crucially, the <gi>idno</gi> and <gi>date</gi> should give the URL where this

	    The exemplified optional audio (or video) recording information is meant for

	    transcription of the corpus component; for cases when the media are further
	    segmented, e.g. by speech, a different encoding is used, which is further
	    explained in the Section on XXX (TO DO!).</p>

	    <p>As the example shows, the recording statement contains a <gi>recording</gi>
	    element, which specifies the <att>type</att> of the recording (<val>audio</val> or

	    (typically the official governmental site for parliamentary proceedings) and the
	    local (possibly processed) copy of the file; this can be a local file, even though
	    it won't be distributed together with the ParlaMint corpus or, better, a Web-based
	    file on a stable location.</p>

            <head>Tags declaration</head>
	    
	    <p>The tags declaration, <gi>tagsDecl</gi> of the corpus root gives the
	    count of all the XML tags used in the data part (so, not in the TEI
	    header) of the corpus (for the corpus root) or in an individual component
	    of the corpus. To distinguish the TEI elements from the possible use of
	    elements from other namespaces, a <gi>namespace</gi> element giving the
	    TEI namespace in its <att>name</att> attribute is introduced
	    first. Inside it, each TEI tag is listed in its own <gi>tagUsage</gi>
	    element, with the attribute <att>gi</att> giving the name of the tag and
	    <att>occurs</att> the number of occurrences, as shown in the following
	    example:
	    
	    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-tagsDecl">
	      <tagsDecl>
		<namespace name="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">

		  <tagUsage gi="note" occurs="85525"/>
		  <tagUsage gi="gap" occurs="7897"/>
		  <tagUsage gi="vocal" occurs="1740"/>
		  <tagUsage gi="incident" occurs="37"/>

	      </tagsDecl>
	    </egXML>
	    
	    It should be noted that similar to the extents (as explained in the Section on
	    <ref target="#sec-extent">Extents</ref>) the tag usage is inserted into
	    the TEI headers in the finalisation of a corpus (cf. the Section on <ref
	    target="#sec-conversion">Validation and conversion</ref>) by a common
	    script, so it is not necessary compute it the process of developing a
	    ParlaMint corpus.</p>
	  </div>
	  
          <div xml:id="sec-classDecl">
            <head>Class declaration</head>
	    
            <p>The class declaration, <gi>classDecl</gi> is used only in the corpus
            root, and contains the definition of controlled vocabularies used in
            ParlaMint corpora and encoded as taxonomies, using the <gi>taxonomy</gi>
            element.  ParlaMint requires three taxonomies to be defined in the root
            class declaration. In the example below, we give only the simplest of
            them, which contains the categories that defined two subcorpora of a
            ParlaMint corpus, namely the COVID part, and the reference part, predating
            the COVID part:
            
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-taxo">

                    <catDesc xml:lang="en">
                    <term>COVID</term>: COVID subcorpus, from 2019-11-01 onwards</catDesc>
		  </category>
		</taxonomy>
	      </classDecl>
            </egXML>
	    
	    A <gi>taxonomy</gi> thus first bilingually describes, via <gi>desc</gi>, what it
	    is a taxonomy of, and then lists (the possibly nested) categories in
	    <gi>category</gi> elements. Crucial here is the value of their <att>xml:id</att>
	    attributes, by which a category is referred to, e.g. via the <att>ana</att>
	    attribute of some other element, as was already explained in the Section on <ref
	    target="sec-roottags">Attributes of top-level elements</ref>, in connection with
	    classifying a corpus component via the <att>ana</att> attribute of its
	    <gi>TEI</gi> element. The category then bilingually glosses its meaning in its
	    <gi>catDesc</gi> elements, which should always first contain the short name of
	    the category, encoded in the <gi>term</gi> element.</p>

	    <p>As mentioned, ParlaMint requires three taxonomies to be defined in the class
	    declaration of the corpus root (as well as a fourth one for the linguistically
	    annotated corpus, as further described in the Section on <ref
	    target="#sec-ana-metadata">Linguistic metadata</ref>). The taxonomies are, for
	    ParlaMint corpora, defined globally and available as part of the data on the <ref
	    target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint/">ParlaMint GitHub
	    repository</ref>. They should be inserted unchanged in the corpus header, but if
	    there is a need to modify them, e.g. by inserting translations into a new local
	    language, then this change needs to be agreed to and pushed to the repository.</p>

	    <p>The three defined taxonomies are:
	    
	    <list>
	      <item>The <hi>subcorpus</hi> taxonomy, already given in the example</item>
	      
	      <item>The taxonomy of <hi>speaker types</hi>, which distinguishes e.g. the
	      chair, an ordinary speaker, and a guest speaker.</item>
	      
	      <item>The <hi>legislature</hi> taxonomy, which gives the possible
	      organisations of a parliament, and is by far the most complex one, and will
	      likely still have to be updated in line with the requirements of new corpora.</item>
	      
	    </list>
	    </p>
          </div>
	</div>

        <div xml:id="sec-profileDesc">
          <head>Profile description</head>
	  
	  <p>The profile description, <gi>profileDesc</gi> is the third main division of the
	  metadata provided by the TEI header. It contains a description of
	  non-bibliographic aspects of the corpus, for example the list of speakers with
	  their metadata. For the corpus root, it contains four elements, of which only the
	  first, the <gi>settingDesc</gi> is used in corpus components. The elements are
	  listed below:

	  <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-profileDesc">
	    <profileDesc>
	      <settingDesc>...</settingDesc>
	      <textClass>...</textClass>
	      <particDesc>...</particDesc>
	      <langUsage>...</langUsage>
	    </profileDesc>
	  </egXML>
	  We explain the contents of each element in the following sections.
	  </p>	    
	  
          <div xml:id="sec-settingDesc">
            <head>Setting description</head>
	    
	    <p>The setting description, <gi>settingDesc</gi>, is used by both the corpus
	    root and corpus components, and contains only one element, <gi>setting</gi>,
	    which then gives information on where and when the meetings included too place.
	    Below is given an example of a corpus root setting description:
	    
	    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-settingDescRoot">
	      <settingDesc>
		<setting>
		  <name type="place">Westminster</name>
		  <name type="city">London</name>
		  <name type="country" key="GB">U.K.</name>
		  <date from="2015-01-01" to="2021-03-31"/>
		</setting>
	      </settingDesc>
	    </egXML>
	    
	    As can be seen, the location of the meeting is given in <gi>name</gi> elements
	    with the <att>type</att> attribute further specifying what kind of location this
	    is, with <val>country</val> (or <val>region</val> for regional parliaments)
	    additionally having the <att>key</att>, which gives is ISO 3166 code, as
	    explained in the Section on <ref target="sec-standard">Standard values</ref>.
	    It also contains the interval (for the corpus root) of the dates of the
	    transcripts included in the corpus. Note that this date range is also given in
	    the <gi>sourceDesc</gi>, as explained in the Section on the <ref
	    target="#sec-sourceDesc">Source description</ref>.</p>
	    
	    <p>The setting description is also present in corpus components, and is very
	    similar to the one in the corpus root, except that it can additionally specify
	    the location of the meeting and give its exact date, as illustrated below:
	    
	    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-settingDescComp">
	      <settingDesc>
		<setting>
		  <name type="place">Commons Chamber</name>
		  <name type="place">Westminster</name>
		  <name type="city">London</name>
		  <name type="country" key="GB">U.K.</name>
		  <date when="2019-02-18">February 18th, 2019</date>
		</setting>
	      </settingDesc>
	    </egXML>
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  
          <div xml:id="sec-textClass">
            <head>Text class</head>
	    
	    <p>The text class, <gi>textClass</gi> groups information which describes the
	    nature or topic of the corpus in terms of a standard classification scheme. In a
	    ParlaMint corpus root, it contains only the category reference, <gi>catRef</gi>
	    element:
	    
	    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-textClass">
	      <textClass>
		<catRef scheme="#parla.legislature"
			target="#parla.bi #parla.lower #parla.upper"/>
	      </textClass>
	    </egXML>

	    The category reference specifies in the value of the <att>scheme</att> attribute
	    which scheme it uses, and this will always be a pointer to the ParlaMint-wide
	    taxonomy on legislature, as further explained in the Section on the <ref
	    target="#sec-classDecl">Class declaration</ref>. The <att>target</att>
	    attribute then gives pointers to the kind of legislature types the country or
	    region has and what the corpus contains; in the case above, the country has a
	    bicameral parliament, and the corpus contains the transcriptions of both the
	    upper and lower house sittings. In general, the options are:
	    
	    <list>
	      <item><val>#parla.uni</val>: Unicameral parliament</item>
	      <item><val>#parla.bi #parla.lower</val>: Bicameral parliament, lower house only</item>
	      <item><val>#parla.bi #parla.upper</val>: Bicameral parliament, upper house only</item>
	      <item><val>#parla.bi #parla.lower #parla.upper</val>: Bicameral parliament,
	      both houses</item>
	    </list>
	    </p>	    
	  </div>
	  
          <div xml:id="sec-particDesc">
            <head>Participant description</head>
	    
	    <p>The participant description, <gi>particDesc</gi> gives the information about
	    political parties and other <q>organisations</q> relevant to the corpus and the
	    information about the speakers whose speeches constitute the corpus transcripts.
	    This informations is given in dedicated types of lists, <gi>listOrg</gi> for
	    organisations, and <gi>listPerson</gi> for the speakers, as illustrated below:
	    
	    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-particDesc">
	      <particDesc>
		<listOrg>...</listOrg>
		<listPerson>...</listPerson>
	      </particDesc>
	    </egXML>
	    The two section below detail the kind of information ParlaMint requires and allows
	    to describe the organisations and persons.
	    </p>
	    
            <div xml:id="sec-orgs">
	      <head>Organisations</head>
	      
	      <p>Information on political parties, as well as other groupings of people,
	      such as the parliament or ministries, is given in the <gi>listOrg</gi>
	      element, which then contains <gi>org</gi> elements giving information about
	      one organisation and followed by the <gi>listRelations</gi> element giving a
	      list of relations between organisations:

	      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-listOrg">
		<listOrg>
		  <org>...</org>
		  <org>...</org>

		  ...
		  <listRelation>...</listRelation>
		</listOrg>
	      </egXML>
	      </p>

	      <p>We first exemplify the structure of one organisation giving the information
	      about a political party:
	      
	      <!-- Note that @full="init" is misused, at least according to the TEI definition:
		   https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-att.personal.html
		   Legal values are:	
		   yes (yes) the name component is spelled out in full. [Default] 
		   abb (abbreviated) the name component is given in an abbreviated form.
		   init (initial letter) the name component is indicated only by one initial.
	      -->
	      
	      <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-parties">
		<org xml:id="party.PS" role="politicalParty">
                  <orgName full="yes" xml:lang="sl">Pozitivna Slovenija</orgName>
                  <orgName full="yes" xml:lang="en">Positive Slovenia</orgName>
                  <orgName full="init">PS</orgName>
                  <event from="2011-10-22">

		</org>
	      </egXML>
	      
	      First, each organisation must have an <att>xml:id</att> attribute, so that
	      other elements can refer to it. The fact that the organisation is a political
	      party is encoded in the <att>role</att> attribute, and we elaborate on this
	      below.  The name of the party is (preferably bilingually) given in the
	      <gi>orgName</gi> element, which also uses the <att>full</att> attribute to
	      distinguish between the <val>full</val> name of the party and the
	      <val>init</val>ials of the party. Parties are also created and dissolved, and
	      this is indicated by the <gi>event</gi> element, which has as its
	      <gi>label</gi> <val>existence</val>, and where the start of its existence is
	      given in the <att>from</att> attribute; as there is no <att>to</att>
	      attribute, this also means that the party still exists. Finally, there can
	      also be external links giving URLs to further information about the
	      parties. In the example above, these are the Slovene and English Wikipedia
	      pages.</p>

	      <p>Returning to the <att>role</att> attribute, it is the ParlaMint schema
	      (cf. the Section on <ref target="#sec-schemas">ParlaMint schemas</ref>) that
	      gives its set of allowed values. Currently, the list is quite long, as we left
	      it up to the partners of ParlaMint 1 to determine the values, but the main
	      ones are:
	      <list>
		<item><val>government</val>: the government of the country or region,
		further exemplified below</item>
		<item><val>parliament</val>: the parliament of the country or region,
		further exemplified below</item>
		<item><val>politicalParty</val>: a political party</item>
		<!-- The following could surely be better formulated: -->
		<item><val>politicalGroup</val>: a grouping of political parties for the
		purpose of acting as one in the government.</item>
	      </list>
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>The government organisation is required to be present in the
	      <gi>listOrg</gi> of every corpus root and is, by convention, the first
	      organisation in the list. It gives the ID and name of the overall government,
	      but can also introduce the successive governments using the dedicated list
	      element for events, <gi>listEvent</gi>, which then gives the various
	      governments as a series of <gi>event</gi> elements:

	      <p>As mentioned, the relations between various organisations, in particular,
	      which political parties or groups are in the coalition or in opposition and
	      when, are encoded in the final element of <gi>listOrg</gi>, namely
	      <gi>listRelation</gi>, which then contains <gi>relation</gi> elements, as
	      shown in the example below:

	      The type of relation (which can only be <val>coalition</val> or
	      <val>opposition</val>) is given in the <att>name</att> attribute. As a
	      coalition is a mutual relation, the pointers to the party IDs are given in the
	      <att>mutual</att> attribute, whereas an opposition is an <att>active</att>
	      relation of the opposing parties to the government, the pointer to which is
	      given in the <att>passive</att> attribute.  It is also necessary to specify
	      <att>from</att> when and (in cases of past oppositions) <att>to</att> when the
	      parties as listed were in opposition. Finally, it is possible, but not
	      necessary to also give the legislative period and/or the government when this
	      particular coalition / opposition existed.

	      <p>As mentioned, the information on speakers is given in the
	      <gi>listPerson</gi> element of the participant description. This element then
	      contains the list of <gi>person</gi> elements, each of which gives information
	      on an individual speaker, as the example below illustrates:

		  </person>
		  ...
		</listPerson>
	      </egXML>

	      Each <gi>person</gi> must have an <att>xml:id</att> attribute, so that it can
	      be referred to from the transcription. The person name, <gi>persName</gi>
	      gives the name of the person which is further decomposed into the person
	      <gi>surname</gi>(s) and <gi>forename</gi>(s). The person must also have the
	      <gi>sex</gi> element, with the <att>value</att> attribute being one of the
	      controlled values: <val>M</val> for male, <val>F</val> for female,
	      <val>O</val> for other, <val>N</val> for none or <val>U</val> for unknown.</p>

	      <p>Apart from the obligatory metadata on the speakers above, the speakers who
	      are MPs or members of political parties (or groups) should also have this
	      information recorded in their <gi>affiliation</gi> elements, as shown in the

		</person>
	      </egXML>
	      The type of affiliation is given in the <att>role</att> attribute of
	      <gi>affiliation</gi>, which has controlled values given by the ParlaMint
	      schema. Apart from <val>MP</val> for members of parliament and
	      <val>member</val> for membership in e.g. political parties or groups (but
	      possibly also commissions etc.) the other legal values are
	      <val>substituteMP</val>, <val>president</val>, <val>vicePresident</val>,
	      <val>chairman</val>, <val>viceChairman</val>, and <val>minister</val>.</p>

	      <p>The <att>ref</att> attribute points to the organisation in which the person has
	      a role. For MPs, this will always be the ID of the parliament or, for
	      bicameral parliaments, one of the houses. For membership in a party this is,
	      of course, be the ID of the party organisation.  The affiliation element also
	      has the usual <att>from</att> and <att>to</att> attributes. Finally, it can
	      also have the <att>ana</att> attribute, which points to the appropriate
	      legislative period when the person was affiliated with the specified
	      organisation.</p>

	      <p>Finally, the person element can also contain other, optional information,
	      such as the date and place of <gi>birth</gi> (and <gi>death</gi>), their
	      official Web page, and a picture of the speaker, as illustrated below:

	    <p>The language usage, <gi>langUsage</gi> is the fourth and last element of the
	    profile description of a corpus root and defines the languages that are used in
	    the corpus. Typically the language use will define (bilingually) only two
	    languages, the language of the transcription and English, as the language used in
	    the metadata, for example:
	    
	    <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-langUsage">
              <langUsage>

              </langUsage>
	    </egXML>
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>In cases where the transcription contains more than one language, the
            percentage of their use can also be indicated in the <att>usage</att> element of
            the <gi>language</gi> elements, as illustrated in the example below:

	  <div xml:id="sec-revisionDesc">
	    <head>Revision description</head>
            <p>The revision description, <gi>revisionDesc</gi> is the fourth, and last element
            of the TEI header. It is an optional element that can appear in the corpus root or
            component, and documents the revisions made in the corpus or component. Its
            structure is illustrated below:
	    
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-revisionDesc">
	      <revisionDesc>
		<change when="2021-06-11">

		<change when="2021-05-28">
		<name>Tomaž Erjavec</name>: Built corpus.</change>
	      </revisionDesc>
	    </egXML>
	    The revision description consists of a series of <gi>change</gi> elements, with
	    the attribute <att>when</att> giving the date of the change, and the content
	    containing the <gi>name</gi> of the person responsible for the change, and a
	    free-text description of the change.</p>
	  </div>
	</div>
      </div>

      <div xml:id="chp-transcript">
        <head>Transcriptions</head>
        
        <p>The transcriptions are encoded in the <gi>text</gi> element of corpus components.  This
        element contains only the element <gi>body</gi>, which should then contain at least
        one division, <gi>div</gi>, as illustrated below:
	
        <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-div">
	  <text ana="#reference">
	    <body>
	      <div type="debateSection">...</div>
	      <div type="debateSection">...</div>
	      ...
	    </body>
	  </text>
        </egXML>
	
	As shown, the <gi>text</gi> element should be (as is the top level <gi>TEI</gi> element,
	as discussed in the Section on <ref target="#sec-roottags">Attributes of top-level
	elements</ref>) marked with the <att>ana</att> attribute as to which subcorpus the text
	belongs to, with the subcorpora themselves defined in the appropriate taxonomy (cf. the
	Section on <ref target="#sec-classDecl">Class declaration</ref>).</p>

	<div xml:id="chp-div">
          <head>Divisions</head>
	  
	  <p>A text body contains a series of divisions, <gi>div</gi> in cases when the source
	  document can be reliably split into sections, which is typically done on the basis of
	  headings identified in the source; when this is not possible, the complete body will be
	  just one division. ParlaMint requires that each division has the <att>type</att>
	  attribute with the fixed value <val>debateSection</val>.</p>
	  
	  <p>Inside a division, the main elements of interest are speeches, encoded as the
	  utterance element, <gi>u</gi>. However, the transcription can also contain headings and
	  notes by the transcribers that serve to structure and comment the speeches, as well as
	  page breaks, and these can also appear directly inside the section(s), as illustrated
	  below:
	  
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-div-detail">
	    <text ana="#reference">
	      <body>
		<div type="debateSection">
		  <pb n="1"/>
		  <head>Child Poverty Unit</head>
		  <note>Question</note>
		  <note>Asked by</note>
		  <u>...</u>
		  ...
		  <pb n="2"/>
		  ...
		</div>
		<div type="debateSection">
		  <head>Trade Union Act 2016 (Political Funds)</head>
		  <note>Motion to Approve</note>
		  <note>Moved by</note>
		  <u>...</u>
		  ...
		</div>
		...
	      </body>
	    </text>
	  </egXML>
	  
	  It should be noted that heads, i.e. the element <gi>head</gi> can appear only at the
	  start of divisions, while notes can be interspersed with speeches anywhere and can also
	  appear inside speeches. It is also possible to specify the type of note, and, in fact,
	  to use more precise elements than just note, which is further explained in the Section
	  on <ref target="#sec-comments">Transcriber comments</ref>.</p>

	  <p>Page breaks, <gi>pb</gi> are an optional element, and can also appear both directly
	  inside divisions or inside utterances. They are used to preserve the page breaks from
	  the digital source, possibly together with the page number, as the value of the
	  <att>n</att> attribute. They can also point to the source of a particular page in the
	  corpus via the <att>source</att> attribute and also to their media file via the
	  <att>corresp</att> attribute (cf. the Section on <ref target="#sec-sourceDesc">Source
	  description</ref> and esp. the <ref target="#exa-sourceDescComp">Example on the source
	  description of a component file</ref>), as illustrated in the example below:

        <div xml:id="sec-uterrance">
          <head>Utterances</head>
          <p>A speech is marked up using the <gi>u</gi> (utterance) element, as illustrated below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-speech">
            <u who="#DavidPrior" ana="#regular">
              <seg>I ask that the draft Regulations laid before the House on 5 December be approved.</seg>
              <seg>The relevant document is the 20th Report from the Legislation Committee.</seg>
            </u>
          </egXML>
          
          The most important attribute of an utterance is <att>who</att>, which gives the pointer
          to the <gi>person</gi> element containing the metadata of the speaker, which is
          discussed in the Section on <ref target="#sec-speakers">Speakers</ref>. Despite its
          importance in allowing analyses of speeches by speaker (and their metadata) it does
          happen that the speaker of every speech cannot be determined; for such cases, the
          <att>who</att> attribute should be omitted.</p>

	  <p>The <gi>u</gi> element should also have the <att>ana</att> attribute giving a pointer
	  to the typology of types of speakers, which is especially important to enable the
	  distinction between the speeches of a session chair (who mostly speak on procedural
	  matters) from regular, and, possibly, guest speakers.</p>
          
          <p>The utterances are then segmented using the <gi>seg</gi> element, which encodes the
          paragraphs of the source transcription. Even if the source files do not contain
          paragraph markings, each speech should contain at least one segment.</p>

	  <p>Finally, an utterance (just as a division) can also contain transcriber comments
	  (note), as further detailed in the next section.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div xml:id="sec-comments">
          <head>Transcriber comments</head>
          
          <p>Transcriber comments encode information such as who spoke, what the time was,
          interruptions, notes on what is happening in the chamber, results of voting, etc.  Note
          that while section headings can also be taken as a kind of transcriber comments, these
          serve to structure a document, these are encoded as <gi>head</gi> elements, as explained
          at the start of this chapter, cf. the <ref target="#exa-div">Example</ref> there.</p>

          <p>In general, transcriber comments are encoded using <gi>note</gi>, which can be
          further qualified via its <att>type</att> attribute; note that we do not, currently,
          specify what the valid values of this attribute are. Some comments can also be encoded
          using more precise TEI elements, as further explained below. The following example gives
          typical transcriber comments:

          The first note simply gives the speaker of the utterance that would follow it, the
          second one gives the time when the session started, while the third and fourth are notes
          on the voting results.</p>

          <p>Some types of transcriber comments, which we term <term>incidents</term> can also be
          encoded using more specific TEI elements than simply <gi>note</gi>. These elements can
          also be further qualified by the <att>type</att> attribute, with the values being
          determined by the ParlaMint schema. The three incident elements are:
          <list>
            <item><gi>vocal</gi> marks any vocalised but not necessarily lexical phenomenon, with
            the values of the (for this element) obligatory <att>type</att> attribute being
            e.g. <val>interruption</val>, <val>laughter</val>, <val>murmuring</val>.</item>
	    
            <item><gi>kinesic</gi> marks any communicative phenomenon, not necessarily vocalised,
            with the optional <att>type</att> values being e.g. <val>applause</val>,
            <val>laughter</val>, <val>gesture</val>.</item>
	    
            <item><gi>incident</gi> marks any phenomenon or occurrence, not necessarily vocalised
            or communicative, with the optional <att>type</att> values being
            e.g. <val>break</val>, <val>sound</val>, <val>action</val>.</item>
          </list>
          
          The example below illustrates the use of these three elements:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-incidents">
            <vocal type="interruption">
              <desc>sounds from the chamber</desc>
            </vocal>
	    ...
            <kinesic type="signal">
              <desc>signal for end of debate</desc>
            </kinesic>
	    ...
	    <incident type="action">
              <desc>minute of silence</desc>
            </incident>
          </egXML>
          
	  As the example shows, the original content of the transcriber comment is retained in the
	  <gi>desc</gi> element, Note that in cases when the agent of an incident is know, they
	  can be specified in the optional <att>who</att> attribute.</p>

          <p>It should be noted that <gi>note</gi> and the four incident elements can be placed
          directly inside <gi>div</gi>, <gi>u</gi> or <gi>seg</gi>. It is recommended to place
          them as far up the hierarchy as possible, and especially avoid having them inside
          <gi>seg</gi> (which contains text), as placing these elements there leads to mixed
          content, which is difficult to process further, in particular when linguistically
          annotating the corpus. However, if a transcriber comment is placed in the middle of the
          text, then it needs to be encoded inside the segment, except if the utterance is split,
          as is further explained in the Section on <ref target="#sec-interruptions">Interrupted
          utterances</ref>.</p>
        </div>

        <div xml:id="sec-gaps">
          <head>Gaps</head>

	  <p>The transcribers can also comment that a part of the speech was not
	  transcribed, e.g. because the recording was not understood, sometimes also noting
	  the reason why, such as that the microphone was not turned on, that there was
	  noise in the chamber, or that the speaker was speaking too quietly. These notes
	  can be encoded as the <gi>gap</gi> element, which is then also marked by
	  <att>reason</att>=<val>inaudible</val>.  The original transcriber note can be
	  left in the <gi>desc</gi> element, as illustrated below.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-gap">
	    ... I would further state that
	    <gap reason="inaudible">
	      <desc>incomprehensible</desc>
	    </gap>
	    and furthermore ...
          </egXML>
	  </p>

	  <p>The other reason for omitting a part of the transcription can be an editorial
	  decision of the corpus compilers. The transcript can, for example, contain material that
	  they do not want to include in the corpus, such as tables, or parts of the transcription
	  that cannot be converted to text. In these cases, the reason given should be
	  <val>editorial</val>, while the <gi>desc</gi> should contain what has been omitted, as
	  illustrated below.
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-gap-editorial">
            <gap reason="editorial">
              <desc xml:lang="en">Table omitted</desc>
            </gap>
          </egXML>
	  </p>

        <div xml:id="sec-interruptions">
          <head>Interrupted utterances</head>
	  
          <p>A special case occurs when a transcription note states that somebody interrupted the
          speaker and gives the transcript of the interruption, possibly with who interrupted,
          with the main speaker then continuing with their speech, as in the following made up
          snippet:
          
          <eg>Boris Johnson: I propose a no-deal Brexit. /Jeremy Corbyn: Traitor!/ Because 
          England does not want any dealings with the European Union.</eg>
          
          The standard manner in which such interruptions are encoded is using the default
          <gi>note</gi> element, or, much better, the <gi>vocal</gi> element, as explained in the
          Section on <ref target="sec-comments">Transcriber comments</ref>, as below:

          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-split-vocal">
            <u who="#BorisJohnson" ana="#regular">
	      <seg>I propose a no-deal Brexit. <vocal type="interruption"><desc>Jeremy Corbyn:
	      Traitor!</desc></vocal> Because England does not want any dealings with the European
	      Union.</seg>
	    </u>
          </egXML>

	  This solution is easy to implement, however, it has the disadvantage of leaving what is
	  essentially a speech as the content of a comment. In cases where it is possible to
	  consistently identify such <q>mini speeches</q>, an alternative and more useful encoding
	  will turn this comment into a separate speech, and splits the main utterance into two
	  (or more) pieces. The example below illustrates how this is encoded:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-splitu">
            <u who="#BorisJohnson" ana="#regular" xml:id="GB001.8.3" next="#GB001.8.5">I propose a no-deal Brexit.</u>
            <u who="#JeremyCorbyn" ana="#regular" xml:id="GB001.8.4">Traitor!</u>
            <u who="#BorisJohnson" ana="#regular" xml:id="GB001.8.5" prev="#GB001.8.3">Because England does not want any dealings with the European Union.</u>
          </egXML>
          
          As can be seen, the split is indicated by the use of the <att>next</att> attribute on
          the first part of the split utterance and by the <att>prev</att> attribute of the next
          part of the split utterance. The values of the attributes are pointers to the next of
          previous identifiers of the appropriate part of the split utterance.<note>Note that, in
          general, the utterance can also be split in the middle of a sentence, which brings with
          it problems for automatic linguistic processing, as, ideally, the parts should be first
          joined, and only then processed.</note>. In the example the speaker of the interrupting
          speech has also been identified and marked in the <att>who</att> attribute; in cases
          where this is not possible, this attribute can be omitted. An additional problem occurs
          with the type of speaker encoded as the value of <att>ana</att>, which is a required
          attribute but this information is not explicitly present in the source
          transcription. Probably the only way in which the type of interrupting speaker can be
          determined is to check the other speeches by this speaker in the same session, and
          assign the same value to <att>ana</att>. But if the speaker cannot be identified or has
          not spoken, then we suggest that the <val>#regular</val> speaker is assumed.</p>

      <div xml:id="chp-linguistic">
        <head>Linguistic annotation</head>

        <p>This section introduces the linguistic annotation that is required by
        ParlaMint. An important note is that a linguistically annotated ParlaMint corpus is
        stored separately from its base (or <term>plain-text</term>) version, i.e. the
        version that has been discussed in the preceding sections. The linguistically
        annotated version differs from the plain-text one in the following respects:
	
	<list>
	  <item>All the file names (so, the corpus root and all the corpus components) have
	  the added extension <code>.ana</code>, which comes before the <code>.xml</code>
	  file extension. For example, if the plain-text root has the file name
	  <code>ParlaMint-CZ.xml</code>, the linguistically annotated one will be
	  <code>ParlaMint-CZ.ana.xml</code>, and if a plain-text component is
	  <code>ParlaMint-CZ_2016-04-13.xml</code> the linguistically annotated one will
	  be <code>ParlaMint-CZ_2016-04-13.ana.xml</code></item>
	  
	  <item>Because the file ID (i.e. the value of the top level element attribute
	  <att>xml:id</att>, as explained in the Section on <ref
	  target="#sec-roottags">Attributes of top-level elements</ref>) should be the
	  same as the file name (cf. the Section on <ref target="#sec-files">File names and
	  directory structure</ref>), the previous point also means that the
	  linguistically annotated files should have the top level ID suffixed with
	  <code>.ana</code>, e.g. <code>&lt;teiCorpus
	  xml:id="ParlaMint-FR.ana"&gt;</code></item>

	  <item>The corpus stamp in the main title of the corpus root or components
	  (cf. the Section on <ref target="#sec-titleStmt">Title statement</ref>) which is
	  <code>[ParlaMint]</code> in the plain-text version, should be
	  <code>[ParlaMint.ana]</code> for the linguistically annotated version.</item>
	  
	  <item>All the plain text of the utterance segments (i.e. the text immediately
	  contained by the <gi>seg</gi> elements) of the plain-text version should be
	  linguistically annotated on the specified levels, as is further explained in the
	  following Section on <ref target="#sec-ana-markup">Linguistic
	  markup</ref>.</item>
	  
	  <item>The linguistically annotated version of the corpus should also have some
	  added metadata in the TEI header, which is detailed in the following Section on
	  <ref target="#sec-ana-metadata">Metadata for linguistic annotation</ref>.</item>

	</list>
	</p>
        
	<div xml:id="sec-ana-markup">
	  <head>Linguistic markup</head>

	  <p>Linguistic annotation is added only to the text content of <gi>seg</gi> elements
	  (which are themselves contained in utterances <gi>u</gi>). For this text, ParlaMint
	  requires the following additional markup to be present:
	  <list>
	    <item>tokens: what is a word, and what is punctuation, with preserved
	    information on inter-token spaces;</item>
	    
	    <item>sentences: what is a sentence;</item>
	    
	    <item>lemmas: what is the base form of each word;</item>
	    
	    <item><ref target="https://universaldependencies.org/">Universal
	    Dependencies</ref> (UD) part-of-speech and morphological features, and,
	    optionally part-of-speech tags from a different (local) tagset;</item>
	    
	    <item>named entities: what is a name, categorised at least into the standard
	    four NE classes;</item>
	    
	    <item>UD syntactic parse of the sentences.</item>
	  </list>

            <head>Word-level annotation</head>
            
            <p>Basic linguistic annotation comprises tokenisation, sentence segmentation,
            part-of-speech tagging and lemmatisation, and this mark-up is illustrated in the
            example below:

            Sentences are marked up using the <gi>s</gi> element, words with the
            <gi>w</gi> element and punctuation symbols with the <gi>pc</gi> element. To
            retain the linguistically significant whitespace, the <att>join</att> element
            with the value <val>right</val> is used, meaning there should be no whitespace
            to the right of the token. There can be (depending on the language and
            annotation tool used) and added complication with tokenisation, which is
            further taken up in the next Section on <ref target="sec-ana-norm">Syntactic
            words</ref>.

	    </p>
            
            <p>The base form or lemmas of a word is given as the value of the <att>lemma</att>
            attribute, while punctuation characters, <gi>pc</gi>, do not have a

            <p>The UD part-of-speech and morphological features are both packed in the
            <att>msd</att> attribute, with the part-of-speech having the <code>UPosTag</code>
            linguistic attribute, and the features separated by the vertical bar.</p>

	    <p>ParlaMint also allows (but does not require) part-of-speech tags from
	    another tagset<note>These are typically tagset developed and used for specific
	    languages and can be found in the XPOS column of CoNLL-U files, which is the
	    native format for UD treebanks.</note> to be added to the linguistic
	    annotation. Where this information is encoded, depends of the type of tagset.</p>

	    <p>For <term>synthetic tagsets</term>, such as the <ref
	    target="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html">Penn
	    Treebank tagset</ref>, which have atomic tags that cannot always be decomposed
	    into attribute-value pairs (e.g. the tag <q>TO</q> for the word <q>to</q>)
	    should be encoded using the <att>pos</att> on words and punctuation symbols, as
	    shown in the example below:

            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-pos">

	    <p>For <term>analytic tagsets</term>, where a part-of-speech tag can be always

	    The <code>mte:</code> is a prefix that is, via the TEI extended pointer syntax
	    as defined in the TEI header (cf. the Section on <ref
	    target="#sec-ana-prefixDef">Prefix definitions</ref>) expanded so that the
	    value of such an <att>ana</att> attribute points to the expansions of the

	    would be expanded to

          <div xml:id="sec-ana-norm">
            <head>Syntactic words</head>
            
            <p>Certain frameworks, in particular the UD one (cf. their information on <ref
            target="https://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/tokenization.html">Tokenization
            and Word Segmentation</ref> and on <ref
            target="https://universaldependencies.org/format.html#words-tokens-and-empty-nodes">Words,
            Tokens and Empty Nodes</ref>), allow for tokens to be decomposed into several words,
            and it is these syntactic words, and not tokens, that are further annotated.</p>

	    <p>To allow for such mismatches between word tokens and syntactic words, we use
	    embedded empty words with associated <att>norm</att> attributes and the standard
	    attributes with linguistic annotation. For example, Czech has the word <q>abyste</q>
	    which is in UD decomposed into two syntactic words, <q>aby</q> and <q>byste</q>. This
	    should be encoded as in the following example<note>Note that the example is rendered
	    in three lines, however, the correct encoding in the corpus is actually in a single
	    line, without any spaces between the elements, as otherwise the new line and
	    indenting spaces are actually a part of the word <q>abyste</q>.</note>:

            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-ana-norm1">
	      <w>abyste
  	      <w norm="aby" lemma="aby" msd="UPosTag=SCONJ"/>

              </w>
            </egXML>
	    
	    Note also that if such a multi-word token does not have a space following it,
	    <code>join="right"</code> should be added to the top level word.</p>
	    
            <p>While we do not have examples of such a practice yet, there could also be cases
            where two (or more) tokens words correspond to one syntactic word. In such cases it
            is the syntactic word that is on the top level, while the inner words are the actual
            tokens. To take an example from historical language, Slovene used to form the
            superlative form of adjectives with the word <q>naj</q> written separately (and often
            as <q>nar</q>), while in contemporary Slovene the <q>naj</q> is a prefix of the
            adjective. This would be encoded as follows:
            
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-ana-norm2">
	      <w norm="najlepši" lemma="lep"><w>nar</w> <w>lepši</w></w>
            </egXML>
	    In this case, if such a multi-token syntactic word would not have a space following
	    it, <code>join="right"</code> should be added to the last token,
	    i.e. <q>lepši</q>.</p>

	    These types are also specified in a specialised taxonomy, as further explained in the
	    Section on <ref target="sec-ana-taxo">Linguistic taxonomies</ref>.</p>
            
	    <p>The identified names and their type are marked up as the <gi>name</gi> element
	    with the appropriate value of its <att>type</att> attribute, as shown in the example below:
	    
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-ana-name">
	      ...
              <w lemma="and" msd="UPosTag=CCONJ">and</w>

	      ...
            </egXML>
            </p>

	    <p>ParlaMint also supports more complex NE annotation schemes, such as the one <ref
	    target="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~strakova/cnec2.0/ne-type-hierarchy.pdf">used for
	    Czech data</ref>, which introduces very detailed NE types and also allows for nested
	    named entities. The example below gives such a case, where the top level and
	    ParlaMint-compatible person name also contains nested names:

            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-analysis-name-complex">
	      <name type="PER" ana="ne:p">

		  <w>Františka</w> 
		</name> 
		<name ana="ne:ps"> 
		  <w>Laudáta</w> 
		</name>
	      </name>
	    </egXML>

	    Here, the language specific NE annotations are given as the value of the
	    <att>ana</att> attribute, which are pointers using the TEI extended pointer syntax
	    (cf. the Section on <ref target="#sec-ana-prefixDef">Prefix definitions</ref>) into a
	    corpus-specific taxonomy that defines these local NE types (for how ParlaMint
	    linguistic taxonomies are defined, cf. the Section on <ref
	    target="sec-ana-taxo">Linguistic taxonomies</ref>).

            <p>The final ParlaMint annotation level is that of dependency syntax, more precisely
            the syntactic analysis according to the Universal Dependences for the particular
            language. These analyses are encoded inside their sentence mark-up, although in a
            stand-off manner. This means that each token must be given an ID, while the syntactic
            analysis is stored in the link group, <gi>linkGrp</gi> element, which is then
            composed of <gi>link</gi> elements. The example below illustrating this is given, for
            readability, without the word-level linguistic attributes and with shortened IDs:

	      </s>
	    </egXML>
	    
	    The example shows that each token, as well as the sentence element should be given an
	    <att>xml:id</att> attribute, that the link group comes at the end (but inside) the
	    sentence, that <gi>linkGrp</gi> has two attributes <att>targFunc</att> and
	    <att>type</att>, both with fixed values, and that it contains a series of empty
	    <gi>link</gi> elements.</p>
	    
            <p>The link elements then give, via the value of their <att>target</att> attribute
            references the head and argument tokens of the syntactic relation which is specified
            in the <att>ana</att> attribute. By convention the links are ordered so that the
            argument token references follow the ordering of the tokens in the sentence. Note
            also that for the top level <code>root</code> relation, the head is the sentence
            ID.</p>
	    
            <p>The relations themselves are pointers which use the <code>ud:</code> prefix that
            is, via the TEI extended pointer syntax as defined in the TEI header (cf. the Section
            on <ref target="#sec-ana-prefixDef">Prefix definitions</ref>) expanded so that the
            value of such an <att>ana</att> attribute points to the categories of the special UD
            syntactic taxonomy which must be a part of the linguistically annotated version of
            the corpus; how to insert this taxonomy is specified in the Section on <ref
            target="#sec-ana-taxo">Linguistic taxonomies</ref>. There is one more detail to watch
            out for, namely, that UD allows the colon symbol <code>:</code> to appear in extended
            relation, e.g. <code>acl:relcl</code> for relative clause modifier. As we already use
            the colon for the extended pointer prefix, the colons in the relations should be
            changed to underscore, e.g. to <code>ud-syn:acl_relcl</code>. Note, however, that the
            relations specified in a <gi>link</gi> <att>ana</att> attribute are just pointers,
            and could have any value; it is the UD taxonomy that actually determines the correct
            value of the relation.</p>

	<div xml:id="sec-ana-metadata">

	  <p>What kind of metadata a plain-text ParlaMint corpus should contain was explained in

	  detail what additions must be made to the metadata for the linguistically annotated
	  version. Note that the <hi>changes</hi> for this version have been already explained at
	  the start of this <ref target="#chp-linguistic">Chapter</ref>. In short, there are
	  three additional parts that should be added to the <gi>teiHeader</gi> of the corpus
	  root, namely a description of the tool(s) used to linguistically annotate the corpus,
	  two additional taxonomies (one for named entities, and one for UD syntactic relations)
	  and the definition of the prefix expansions for UD syntactic relations and named
	  entities. These descriptions should also serve as the point of departure for those that
	  want to introduce their own prefixes and taxonomies for defining additional and
	  corpus-specific part-of-speech tagging schemes or named entity classes.</p>

	  <div xml:id="sec-ana-appInfo">
            <head>Application information for linguistic processing</head>
	    
            <p>As the linguistic analysis of a ParlaMint will be performed by a tool, the
            information on which tool (or tools) have been used should be documented in the
            corpus root TEI header. This information is encoded in the <gi>appInfo</gi> element
            of the <gi>encodingDesc</gi>, as shown in the example below:

            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-ana-appInfo">

		</application>
              </appInfo>
            </egXML>
	    
	    The <gi>appInfo</gi> element contains, in general, a series of <gi>application</gi>
	    elements, each one giving the information on one tool. The element gives the
	    <att>version</att> number of the tool and specifies an <att>ident</att>ifying code
	    and then has two subordinate elements, with <gi>label</gi> giving the name of the
	    tool and <gi>desc</gi> a short description of it, preferably with a pointer to the

	  </div>
	  
	  <div xml:id="sec-ana-taxo">
            <head>Linguistic taxonomies</head>

	    <p>Some linguistic annotations have fixed vocabularies and these should
	    be encoded as taxonomies in the TEI header of the linguistically analysed corpus
	    root, similarly to other taxonomies, as discussed in the Section on the <ref
	    target="#sec-classDecl">Class declaration</ref>.</p>

	    <p>The first taxonomy is the Named entity types, which has - apart from translating
	    the categories into the local language, a fixed structure, as follows:
	    
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-ana-taxonomy-NER">
              <taxonomy xml:id="NER">

		</category>
              </taxonomy>
	    </egXML>
	    </p>

	    <p>The second taxonomy to be inserted is the one for Universal Dependency
	    relations, and this one is language specific, as different languages use a
	    different subset of all the possible UD relations. Below we illustrate by giving a
	    few relation definitions:

            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-ana-taxonomy-UD">
	      <taxonomy xml:id="UD-SYN">
		<desc xml:lang="en">

		<category xml:id="acl">
                  <catDesc xml:lang="en">
                  <term>acl</term>: Clausal modifier of noun (adjectival clause)</catDesc>
		</category>
		<category xml:id="cc_preconj">
                  <catDesc xml:lang="en">
                  <term>cc:preconj</term>: Preconjunct</catDesc>
		</category>
		<category xml:id="dep">
                  <catDesc xml:lang="en">
                  <term>dep</term>: Unspecified dependency</catDesc>
		</category>
		<category xml:id="punct">
                  <catDesc xml:lang="en">
                  <term>punct</term>: Punctuation</catDesc>
		</category>
		<category xml:id="root">
                  <catDesc xml:lang="en">
                  <term>root</term>: Root</catDesc>
		</category>
              </taxonomy>
	    </egXML>
	    The ID and description, <gi>desc</gi> of the <gi>taxonomy</gi> are fixed, and the
	    <gi>category</gi> elements have the usual structure. Note that the ID of a category
	    is identical to its definition in <gi>term</gi>, except that the colon,
	    <code>:</code> in the official name of the relation must be substituted by the
	    underscore, <code>_</code>, to enable correct referencing of these IDs, as
	    discussed in the Section on <ref target="#sec-parses">Syntactic parses</ref>.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <div xml:id="sec-ana-prefixDef">
            <head>Prefix definitions</head>
	    
	    <p>Pointing attributes, such as <att>ana</att>, take as their value a series of
	    references to the value of <att>xml:id</att> elements in an XML document. If this
	    is the same document, then the reference to the ID is the character hash,
	    <code>#</code> prefixed to the particular ID, e.g. <val>#parla.uni</val> and if
	    they are in another XML document, then the hash is prefixed with the URL of the
	    document, e.g.
	    <val>https://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib2-sl.xml#Vmpr1p</val>.</p>

	    <p>Because the complete URL tends to be long, which is especially inconvenient
	    when such references are given to every token in a corpus, TEI introduces the so
	    called Extended pointer syntax, whereby the reference to an ID can be given in the
	    form of a prefix, which is separated by a colon from the local part of the ID
	    reference, and the value of this prefix is determined via the <gi>prefixDef</gi>
	    element in the <gi>profileDesc</gi> of the TEI header. ParlaMint uses this
	    mechanism for all linguistic annotations with a closed vocabulary, in particular
	    for the Universal Dependences syntactic relations and for the optional and
	    corpus-specific analytical part-of-speech tags, as discussed in the Section on <ref
	    target="#sec-parses">Syntactic parses</ref> and <ref
	    target="#sec-ana-words">Word-level annotation</ref>. The example below illustrates
	    the prefix definitions for the obligatory UD syntactic relations and for the
	    optional MULTEXT-East tags:
	    
            <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-ana-listPrefix">
              <listPrefixDef>
		<prefixDef ident="ud-syn" matchPattern="(.+)" replacementPattern="#$1">
		  <p xml:lang="en">Private URIs with this prefix point to elements giving their name. In this document they are simply local references into the UD-SYN taxonomy categories in the corpus root TEI header.</p>
		</prefixDef>
		<prefixDef ident="mte"
			   matchPattern="(.+)"
			   replacementPattern="http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib-sl.xml#$1">
		  <p xml:lang="en">Private URIs with this prefix point to feature-structure elements defining the Slovenian MULTEXT-East Version 6 MSDs.</p>
		</prefixDef>
              </listPrefixDef>
            </egXML>
	    The specialised element for listing prefix definitions, <gi>listPrefixDef</gi> give
	    the series of prefix definitions, <gi>prefixDef</gi>. Each prefix definition
	    defines its prefix as the value of the <att>ident</att> attribute, and then
	    specifies a regular expression that matches the part of the ID reference after the
	    prefix in its <att>matchPattern</att> attribute, and its substitution as the value
	    of the <att>replacementPattern</att> attribute. The first prefix definition thus
	    defined the <code>ud-syn</code> prefix, so for any ID reference with this prefix,
	    e.g. <val>ud-syn:acl_relcl</val>, the part after the prefix
	    (<code>acl_relcl</code>) should me matches against <code>(.+)</code> and the result
	    being the matched part (here the entire relation <code>acl_relcl</code>)
	    substituted then substituted by <code>#$1</code>, i.e. by the hash character
	    followed by the original value, so that <val>ud-syn:acl_relcl</val> gives
	    <val>#acl_relcl</val>. This substitution is of course trivial, and hardly
	    necessary, but was implemented so that all fixed-vocabulary linguistic analyses
	    have the same treatment.</p>
	    
	    <p>More sensible is the second example, where very short ID references, such as
	    <val>mte:Vmpr1p</val> are transformed to
	    <val>https://nl.ijs.si/ME/V6/msd/tables/msd-fslib2-sl.xml#Vmpr1p</val>, as already
	    explained in the Section on <ref target="#sec-ana-words">Word-level
	    annotation</ref>.</p>

	    <p>Finally, each prefix definition also contains a possibly bi-lingual paragraph
	    explaining the definition.</p>

          resource management - Transcription of spoken language</ref>. While the ISO standard
          is better elaborated, it also changes and adds element definitions, so we are using
          the standard TEI variant of speech encoding as far as the schema is concerned, while
          taking into account, as much as possible, specific encoding choices as proposed by
          the ISO standard.</p>
          
          <p>First, TEI offers the <gi>recordingStmt</gi> element (a part of <gi>fileDesc</gi>
          of the TEI header) which contains the information about the recording(s) of the
          transcription. This information can be unstructured (i.e. a series of <gi>ab</gi>
          elements) or structured (contained in the <gi>recording</gi> element); Parla-CLARIN
          recommends the structured version. As shown in the example below, the element
          contains information of the type of recording (audio / video), its duration<note>The
          <att>dur</att> values should follow the <ref

          (<gi>respStmt</gi>) of the person or agency that made the recording, the date when
          the recording file was made and the equipment used:

          <p>As the example below shows, the timeline gives the unit in which the intervals are

          here referring to the first <gi>when</gi> element, at the very start of the
          recording, so specified with the absolute time.  Further <gi>when</gi> elements give

          <p>The IDs of the timeline synchronisation are then used by the <gi>u</gi>

          the first one gives a straightforward temporal structure on the <gi>u</gi>;
	  the second one uses the
          empty <gi>anchor</gi> element to give additional temporal structure for cases where
          the synchronised parts of the utterance are not further marked-up
	  (or the synchronisation is required for elements that don't have the <att>start</att> and
          <att>end</att> attributes); while the third and
          fourth demonstrate the case where two utterances are partially overlapping:<note>Note
          that in such cases we would also use the <att>prev</att> and <att>next</att>
          attributes, as shown in the <ref target="#exa-splitu">Example on split
          utterances</ref>.</note>:

          <head>Facsimile</head>
          <p>In cases where the facsimile of the original transcription is available
          (especially valuable for older parliamentary proceedings, where the exact
          appearance of the original proceedings is of interest), it is advantageous to
          enable viewing the original together with the encoded transcription. How to
          achieve this, in general, is explained in the <ref
          target="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html">Chapter on
          Representation of Primary Sources</ref> of the TEI Guidelines.</p>
          
          <p>The simplest but also the most limiting way to achieve this is to have per-page
          facsimile files and use the page break i.e. <gi>pb</gi> element to mark page
          boundaries in the transcript and then directly specify the image file of the page
          with the <att>facs</att> attribute, as illustrated in the example below:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-pb">
          <body>
          <pb facs="PNG/page1.png"/>
          <!- Text contained on page 1 encoded here: ->
	  ...
          <pb facs="PNG/page2.png"/>
          <!- Text contained on page 2 encoded here: ->
          ...
          </body>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>By convention, this encoding indicates that the image indicated by the
          <att>facs</att> attribute represents the whole of the text following the
          <gi>pb</gi> element, up to the next <gi>pb</gi> element. The page break element
          can also contain a reference to the source HTML of web-harvested proceeding using
          the <att>source</att> attribute, and per-page links to audio or vidoe (cf.  the
          Section on <ref target="#sec-speechvideo">Speech and video</ref>), as illustrated
          in the following example:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-pb-source">
          <pb n="1"
          source="https://www.psp.cz/eknih/2013ps/stenprot/044schuz/s044051.htm"
          xml:id="ParlaMint-CZ_2016-04-13-ps2013-044-02-006-162.pb1"
          corresp="#ps2013-044-02-006-162.audio1"/>
          </egXML>
          </p>
          
          <p>A more complicated solution to referring to facsimiles, where it is possible
          to have several images per page (e.g. in different resolutions) or to specify
          areas of a page is enabled by the <gi>facsimile</gi> element, which should appear
          immediately before the <gi>text</gi> element of a TEI document. The example below
          refers to the first and third pages directly with the <gi>graphic</gi> element,
          whereas the second page is encoded as a <gi>surface</gi> which then contains the
          page image in two resolutions:
          
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" xml:id="exa-facsimile">
          <facsimile>
          <graphic xml:id="page1" url="PNG/page1.png"/>
          <surface xml:id="page2">
          <graphic type="600dpi" url="PNG/page2-highRes.png"/>
          <graphic type="300dpi" url="PNG/page2-lowRes.png"/>
          </surface>
          <graphic xml:id="page3" url="PNG/page3.png"/>
          </facsimile>
          </egXML>
          
          Such definitions are then referred to via local references in <att>facs</att> attribute of
          <gi>pb</gi>, as discussed previosly.</p>
          
          <p>More complicated cases, such as delimiting portions of a page are also supported
          by the TEI Guidelines, and for these the reader is referred directly to the Section
          on <ref

	<head>Validation and conversion</head>
	
	<p>The chapter explains how to validate and finalise a ParlaMint corpus, and introduces
	scripts for converting a ParlaMint corpus to other, derived formats</p>

	<div xml:id="sec-schemas">
	  <head>Validating ParlaMint corpora</head>
	  
	  <p>The XML structure of ParlaMint corpora can be validated via RelaxNG schemas, which
	  exist in two versions, one that was produced as a customisation of the TEI Guidelines,
	  and a set of schemas that were made from scratch for ParlaMint.</p>

	  <p>The TEI customisation is written as a TEI ODD document, and is, in fact, the XML
	  version of this document as available in the <ref
	  target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint/tree/main/TEI">TEI/
	  directory</ref> of the ParlaMint GitHub repository. The XML contains not only the
	  prose guidelines, but also the formal specification of the TEI schema in <ref
	  target="#schema">Appendix A</ref> in the on-line version converted to a reference
	  resource to all the elements, attributes and classes used in ParlaMint corpora. The ODD
	  document is not immediately useful for XML validation, but has to be converted with TEI
	  XSLT stylesheets first in order to obtain a RelaxNG schema, and this schema is also
	  available in the same directory under the name of <ref
	  target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint/blob/main/TEI/ParlaMint.rng">ParlaMint.rng</ref>
	  (in RelaxNG XML syntax) or <ref
	  target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint/blob/main/TEI/ParlaMint.rnc">ParlaMint.rnc</ref>
	  (in RelaxNG compact syntax). This schema should be used to check that ParlaMint
	  component files validate against TEI.</p>
  
	  <p>However, the TEI ParlaMint schema has two drawbacks in using it for ParlaMint corpus
	  validation. First, while the component corpus files can most likely be validated with
	  it, the root file can only be validated by first XIncluding all the component files in
	  the root in order to get a complete <gi>teiCorpus</gi> rooted XML document. But a
	  typical ParlaMint corpus will be too large to perform this kind of validation, so it is
	  not possible to validate the complete corpus; validation can, however, be performed on
	  the much smaller sample corpora as available in the GitHub repository of the
	  project. Secondly, it is difficult to constrain a TEI ODD-derived XML schema to allow
	  only the kinds of nestings and attributes that should appear in a ParlaMint corpus, so
	  this schema allows (and lists <ref target="#schema">Appendix A</ref>) attributes that
	  are in fact forbidden in ParlaMint corpora.</p>
	  
	  <p>For this reason, we have also developed a set of RelaxNG schemas from scratch, which
	  do allow only those elements, attributes and content models that are in fact valid for a
	  ParlaMint corpus. There are all together four schemas, one for a "plain-text" corpus
	  root, one for its corpus components, one for the linguistically annotated corpus root,
	  and one for its components. These schemas can be found in the <ref
	  target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint/tree/main/Schema">Schema/
	  directory</ref> of the ParlaMint GitHub repository, with the README file giving
	  instructions how to use them.</p>

	  <p>While validating with XML schemas checks the formal structure of XML files, it is
	  less successful in validating other aspects of conformance, such as the textual content
	  or linking of pointer attributes. For this reason, we have also developed an XSLT script
	  that assumes a schema-validated ParlaMint file on its input, and checks various other
	  aspects of conformance. These validation scripts can be found in the <ref
	  target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint/tree/main/Scripts">Scripts/
	  directory</ref> of the ParlaMint GitHub repository, with the README file listing them.</p>

	  <p>While each contributor of a ParlaMint corpus should validate their files with the
	  schema and XSLT script, there also exist further stages of validation, which are also
	  applied to ParlaMint corpora:
	  <list>
	    <item>The corpora are converted to derived formats, in particular CoNLL-U and vertical
	    format for CQP-type concordancers, both from the linguistically annotated version of
	    the corpus. The Universal Dependencies project provides a program for validating the
	    formatting and linguistic analyses in CoNLL-U files, and this validation is used on
	    the CoNLL-U files derived from their XML source, up to level 2 conformance. The
	    vertical files, on the other hand, are first compiled with manatee (the back end of
	    (no)Sketch Engine) and this compilation can also expose various errors.</item>

	    <item>The last stage in validation is <q>human validation</q> where e.g. simply
	    looking at various produced metadata files or at the concordances of a corpus exposes
	    errors.</item>
	  </list>
	  </p>

	<div xml:id="sec-final">
          <head>Finalisation of corpora</head>
	  
          <p>While the vast majority of converting source encodings into the ParlaMint corpus
          format is left to the compilers of a corpus, there are a few elements that can be
          produces by common scripts on the basis of nearly finished corpora and lead to the final
          version of the corpus for a particular release. This includes setting the date, edition
          and handle under which the corpus will be distributed, and also calculating the size of
          the corpus (cf. the Sections on <ref target="#sec-extent">Extents</ref> and on <ref
          target="#sec-tagsDecl">Tags declaration</ref>).

	  The script for finalisation can be found in the <ref
	  target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint/tree/main/Scripts">Scripts/
	  directory</ref> of the ParlaMint GitHub repository and the README file briefly explains
	  its function; more comments can be found in the script itself.

          <p>A TEI encoded document is, in general, not meant to be used directly by software
          programs, rather, it serves as an interchange and storage format. The ParlaMint project
          has produced various scripts to down-convert the XML encoded corpora to other formats
          and they can be found in the <ref
          target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint/tree/main/Scripts">Scripts/
          directory</ref> of the ParlaMint GitHub repository, with the README file listing them
          and explaining their function. In short, the programs convert the ParlaMint XML to plain
          text, to CoNLL-U, and to vertical format. There is also a script that takes a ParlaMint
          corpus and makes from it a sample for inclusion to the <ref
          target="https://github.com/clarin-eric/ParlaMint/">ParlaMint GitHub
