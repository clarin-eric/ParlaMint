<note type="comment" content="‘The corona virus infects faster when it gets cold in the weather and people are more indoors. This has resulted in a wave of infection every fall in the last two years, as we are well aware of it from the regular seasonal flu. In December 2021, the wave of infection led to severe measures and the closure of a number of industries, despite almost all being fully vaccinated and one well-started booster doses for specifically postponed groups. Of course, uncertainty about new virus variants, such as the omicron variant, may increase preparedness, but the clear starting point must be that we can live with different variants of the corona virus in the future without the need for infectious measures beyond vaccination."/>
