<note type="comment" content="‘Since 1990, the United Nations Organisation for Agriculture and Food, FAO, has measured the price of the five main sources of activity. FAO figures show that food prices have not been higher than they are today since measurements began. While price increases were relatively stable and slightly increasing for many years, prices have moved up rapidly over the last two years. Increasing food prices have led to political unrest and riots in many countries. The number of people who starve in the world is still very high."/>
