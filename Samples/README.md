# ParlaMint samples

This directory contains samples of corpora by country / region, with the complete corpora available
in a CLARIN repositry (cf. top level [README](../README.md).

The individual directories enable a user to get an impression of the kind of data included in the corpora
before downloading the quite large complete corpora.
Conversely, a potential contributor can first experiment with a sample before trying to "ParlaMintise"
the complete corpus.

Each Sample directory should contain:

* a README giving a short description of the parliamentary system and sources and processing of the corpus;
* the corpus root and associated files;
* a few year directories with a few sampled component files,
  available both in the source ParlaMint TEI and in the available derived formats.
