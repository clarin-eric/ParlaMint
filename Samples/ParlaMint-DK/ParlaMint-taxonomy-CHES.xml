For parties in Central/Eastern Europe, the Derksen classification (now integrated into Wikipedia) is used as a foundation, complemented by two key methods: a) assessing membership or ties to international and EU party associations, and b) self-identification of a party. This classification is periodically updated to account for shifts in party ideologies or organizational changes.

   <category xml:id="ches.most_important_issue">
      <catDesc xml:lang="en"><term>Most important issues</term>: Entries for the next three questions are a summary of the expert responses to the Most Important Issue question. Each expert ranked one issue as the most important, one issue as the second most important, and one issue as the third most important issue. In this dataset, we aggregate these responses using a simple ordinal voting technique. For each party, an issue received 10 points if it is ranked as the #1 issue by an expert 5 points if it is ranked #2 by an expert, and 1 point if it is ranked #3 by an expert. After adding together the issue scores for all the experts for each individual party, we ranked each issue by the total number of points, yielding the MIP_ONE, MIP_TWO, and MIP_THREE variables. Tables with the Most important issue options are available in the 1999-2019 Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) trend file Codebook (https://www.chesdata.eu/s/1999-2019_CHES_codebook.pdf)</catDesc>
