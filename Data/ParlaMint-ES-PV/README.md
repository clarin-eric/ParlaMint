## Documentation
ParlaMint is a project that aims to (1) create a multilingual set of comparable corpora of parliamentary proceedings uniformly encoded according to the Parla-CLARIN recommendations and covering the COVID-19 pandemic from November 2019 as well as the earlier period from 2015 to serve as a reference corpus; (2) process the corpora linguistically to add Universal Dependencies syntactic structures and Named Entity annotation; (3) make the corpora available through concordancers and Parlameter; and (4) build use cases in Political Sciences and Digital Humanities based on the corpus data.
### Characteristics of the national parliament
The Basque Parliament (Basque: Eusko Legebiltzarra, Spanish: Parlamento Vasco) is the legislative body of the Basque Autonomous Community of Spain and the elected assembly to which the Basque Government is responsible. 

The Parliament meets in the Basque capital, Vitoria-Gasteiz, although the first session of the modern assembly, as constituted by the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, was held in Guernica – the symbolic centre of Basque freedoms – on 31 March 1980. 

It is composed of seventy-five deputies representing citizens from the three provinces of the Basque autonomous community. Each province (Álava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay) elects the same number of deputies. 

### Data source and acquisition
The Basque Parliament Office in a session held on March 9, 2021, has adopted to share the transcripts of the Basque Parliament (and their translations, when possible), to that there is a corpus of Basque in the project ParlaMint (2021/1887).

Minutes of the Basque Parliament, Term X, XI and XII (2015 - 2022).

For NER a multilingual xlmroberta was fine-tuned for Basque and Spanish using these tags: PER, LOC, ORG and MISC.
